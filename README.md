# Simulation Shop-Store

This is a web-based simulation of a shop-store. It is a simulation of a shop-store with a queue of clients. This simulation designed in a way that we can change the parameters of the simulation and see the results. Project is written in JavaScript withouth any third-party library.

**Demo:** https://basemax.github.io/SimulationShopStore

## Parameters

In this simulation, we can change the parameters of the simulation.

There are a lot of parameters that we can change. Here is a list of parameters:

- How many clients we can response at a time (parallel)
- Minimum time to respond to a client
- Maximum time to respond to a client
- Number of ready clients in queue
- Maximum size of the queue
- Maximum number of clients for this simulation
- Minimum time to enter the queue
- Maximum time to enter the queue
